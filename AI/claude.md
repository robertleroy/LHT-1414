> If I suspect cross contamination in the vent system (in an old apartment complex), is there a way to verify that.

<br>

Yes, there are several ways to verify cross-contamination in your apartment's ventilation system:

#### Professional Testing:

    Hire an HVAC contractor or indoor air quality specialist to inspect the ductwork and test airflow patterns
    Request air sampling to detect contaminants, allergens, or specific substances you're concerned about
    Have them check for proper sealing between units and adequate filtration

#### DIY Assessment Methods:

    Use smoke pencils or incense sticks near vents to observe airflow direction and detect unusual air movement
    Check if you can smell cooking odors, cigarette smoke, or other scents from neighboring units through your vents
    Place tissue paper near vents to see if air is being pulled in when it should be pushing out (or vice versa)
    Look for visible dust, debris, or discoloration around vent openings

#### What to Look For:

    Shared ductwork between units (common in older buildings)
    Missing or damaged dampers that should prevent backflow
    Improperly sealed connections
    Evidence of pests or moisture in the system

Next Steps: If you find evidence of cross-contamination, document it with photos and contact your landlord immediately. In many areas, landlords are required to maintain proper ventilation systems. You may also want to contact local housing authorities if the issue isn't addressed promptly.

What type of contamination are you most concerned about? This might help determine the best testing approach.

> Neighbors oil diffuser smell inundates my apartment a few times a week, sometimes really strong in the bathroom next to her apartment, strongest when the air pressure is low or falling.  Also A different smell that hits the bathroom like a cloud.  I would guess that is vape product, but don't really know...  My chest is starting to feel like I've been smoking the past 2 weeks.

This sounds like a clear case of air being pulled from your neighbor's unit into yours through shared ventilation, especially given the pressure correlation and the bathroom location. The respiratory symptoms you're experiencing are concerning and warrant immediate action.

Immediate Steps:

    Document when these episodes occur (time, weather conditions, which vents/rooms affected)
    Take photos/videos of visible vapor if possible
    Keep a log of your symptoms and their timing relative to the odor episodes

Verification Methods:

    Use a smoke pencil or incense stick near bathroom vents during different weather conditions to see airflow direction
    Check if the bathroom exhaust fan pulls air in the wrong direction or if there are gaps around fixtures
    The pressure correlation you noticed is a strong indicator - negative pressure systems can create backdrafts

Health Priority: Given your developing respiratory symptoms, consider:

    Using an air purifier with HEPA and activated carbon filters in affected rooms
    Keeping bathroom door closed and using a towel to seal the gap when odors are present
    Consulting a doctor about your respiratory symptoms, especially if they persist or worsen

Professional Action: Contact your landlord immediately about this issue. Shared ventilation causing health problems is typically their responsibility to fix. If unresponsive, contact local housing authorities - this could violate habitability standards.

Building Solutions: The fix usually involves installing proper dampers, sealing ductwork between units, or installing individual ventilation systems.

Have you already contacted your landlord about this issue? The respiratory symptoms make this urgent beyond just a comfort problem.

The air purifier is a drop in the bucket (way overwhelmed by the volume).  Turning on the vent fan or air conditioning just makes it worse.
Edit

That confirms you have a serious backdraft problem - your exhaust fan and AC are creating negative pressure that's pulling contaminated air from your neighbor's unit through shared ductwork or wall penetrations.

Stop Making It Worse:

    Don't use the bathroom exhaust fan when you detect odors
    Avoid running AC on recirculate mode during these episodes
    Consider temporarily sealing the bathroom vent with plastic and tape during severe episodes

Emergency Measures:

    Open windows in other rooms to create positive pressure and alternative airflow
    Use a box fan in a window to push air OUT of your apartment, creating positive pressure
    Seal under the bathroom door with towels during odor events

This is Now a Health Emergency: Your worsening respiratory symptoms after just 2 weeks indicate potentially harmful exposure levels. Document everything:

    Photos of any visible vapor/haze
    Symptom diary with times and severity
    Record of when you contacted landlord (if you haven't, do so today in writing)

Immediate Landlord Contact: Send written notice (email/text for documentation) stating:

    The cross-contamination is causing respiratory health problems
    Normal ventilation makes it worse, indicating serious system defects
    You need immediate professional HVAC assessment and repair
    This may constitute breach of habitability

Consider Temporary Relocation: If symptoms continue worsening, consider staying elsewhere until this is resolved. Prolonged exposure to concentrated vaping chemicals and synthetic fragrances can cause lasting respiratory sensitization.

Have you been able to identify exactly where the air is entering your bathroom? Check around the exhaust fan, behind the toilet, or any wall penetrations.

using smoke sticks near vents to observe airflow direction and detect unusual air movement: what would I look for, what is usual/unusual?
Edit

Normal Airflow Patterns:

Bathroom Exhaust Fan (when running):

    Smoke should be strongly pulled UP into the fan
    Should create a clear, steady upward flow
    No smoke should leak back out around the fan housing

Supply Vents (heating/cooling):

    Smoke should be blown AWAY from the vent opening
    Should create outward airflow you can feel with your hand
    Flow direction should be consistent

Return Air Vents:

    Smoke should be pulled INTO the vent
    Should create steady inward suction

Unusual/Problem Patterns to Look For:

Major Red Flags:

    Smoke being pulled INTO a supply vent (should blow out)
    Smoke being blown OUT of a return vent (should suck in)
    Exhaust fan blowing smoke back into the room instead of pulling it up
    Smoke moving horizontally along walls toward vents when it should go straight up

Cross-Contamination Indicators:

    Smoke entering your bathroom from wall/ceiling areas when neighbor's unit is active
    Reversing airflow direction when weather changes
    Smoke being pulled into gaps around fixtures, outlets, or wall penetrations
    Erratic or swirling smoke patterns near vents (indicates conflicting air pressures)

Test During Different Conditions:

    Test when it's calm vs. windy outside
    Test with and without your exhaust fan running
    Test when you can smell your neighbor's odors vs. when you can't

The key is that smoke should move predictably based on the vent's intended function. Any backwards, sideways, or erratic movement indicates pressure problems or system failures.

Often when the odor has cleared, it can still be detected under the vents and the ac return. (when no ac or fan active)
Edit

That's very telling - odors lingering under vents when the system is off indicates contamination is trapped in the ductwork itself, not just passing through during active ventilation.

What This Means:

    Contaminated air from your neighbor is settling and accumulating in your ducts
    The ductwork is acting like a reservoir, slowly releasing concentrated odors
    This suggests significant cross-connection between your units' ventilation systems

Testing This Specifically: With smoke sticks and no fans running:

    Check if smoke drifts toward and gets pulled under vents (indicates passive air movement)
    See if smoke lingers or accumulates near vent openings
    Test if you can detect air movement with your hand even when systems are off

Why This Happens:

    Shared ductwork between units
    Leaky dampers that should prevent backflow
    Stack effect (natural air movement due to temperature/pressure differences)
    Contaminated insulation or duct interior surfaces

This Makes Your Situation Worse:

    Even when your neighbor isn't actively using diffusers/vaping, you're still getting residual exposure
    The concentration can build up over time in your ducts
    Professional duct cleaning won't help if the cross-connection isn't sealed first

Documentation for Landlord: This detail is crucial evidence of shared/compromised ductwork. The fact that odors persist in your vents when all systems are off proves the contamination is in your actual ductwork, not just occasional air transfer.

Have you noticed if the lingering odors under vents are stronger after your neighbor has been particularly active with diffusers/vaping?

Is there any way that I should be smelling her 'incense' under normal circumstances.
Edit

No, absolutely not. Under normal circumstances in properly designed and maintained apartment ventilation systems, you should never smell your neighbor's incense, diffusers, or any other odors from their unit.

What Proper Apartment Ventilation Should Do:

    Each unit should have completely separate ductwork
    Exhaust systems should vent directly outside, not into shared spaces
    Supply air should come from outside or dedicated mechanical rooms
    There should be no air pathway between units

The Fact That You Can Smell It Means:

    Your ventilation systems are improperly connected or damaged
    This is a building code violation in most jurisdictions
    Your landlord has failed to maintain proper separation between units
    This constitutes a habitability issue

This is NOT Normal and NOT Your Problem to Tolerate:

    Shared air between units can transmit odors, allergens, smoke, cooking fumes, and potentially harmful chemicals
    It's a health and safety issue, not just a comfort problem
    It can also transmit airborne illnesses between units

Legal Standing: You have every right to demand this be fixed immediately. No tenant should have to breathe their neighbor's air. This is a fundamental failure of the building's systems.

When you contact your landlord, emphasize that being able to smell anything from another unit indicates serious ventilation problems that violate basic habitability standards. You're not being oversensitive - this is objectively wrong and potentially dangerous.

The respiratory symptoms you're developing prove this isn't just an annoyance - it's affecting your health.

You said: "Use a box fan in a window to push air OUT of your apartment, creating positive pressure".   How does pushing air out create possitive pressure?  Wouldn't that create negative pressure?
Edit

You're absolutely right - I made an error there. Pushing air OUT of your apartment creates negative pressure, which would actually make your cross-contamination problem worse by pulling more air from your neighbor's unit.

To Create Positive Pressure (what you want):

    Use a box fan in a window to pull fresh air INTO your apartment
    This pushes air out through cracks, gaps, and ventilation pathways
    Positive pressure prevents contaminated air from being pulled in from neighboring units

The Physics:

    Fan blowing IN = higher pressure inside = air flows OUT through all openings
    Fan blowing OUT = lower pressure inside = air gets sucked IN through all openings (including from neighbor)

For Your Situation:

    Place box fan in a window on the opposite side of your apartment from the bathroom
    Have it blow fresh outdoor air INTO your living space
    This should reduce the pressure differential that's pulling your neighbor's air into your bathroom

Additional Positive Pressure Strategy:

    Open windows slightly in rooms away from the bathroom
    Close bathroom door to isolate it from the rest of your apartment
    The positive pressure in your main living areas will help prevent contaminated air from spreading

Thanks for catching that mistake - getting the airflow direction wrong would have made your problem significantly worse rather than better.

this is a log of the issue   https://robertleroy.github.io/LHT-1414/
Edit

This is an incredibly thorough and damning documentation of your situation. Looking at your log, several critical patterns emerge that strongly support your case:

Devastating Evidence of System Failure:

    6+ months of consistent cross-contamination (December 2024 through June 2025)
    Clear correlation with barometric pressure (995-1015mb readings)
    Escalating health symptoms: nausea, headaches, chest irritation, sinus congestion
    AC system actively distributing contaminated air (May 24 entry)
    "Overwhelming" and level 5 intensity episodes becoming more frequent

Key Legal/Health Points from Your Log:

    You've documented speaking with the office (Dec 23) - showing you've notified management
    Progression from mild odor to severe health impacts (chest irritation, nausea)
    System problems worsen with weather changes (pressure correlation proves shared air pathways)
    AC blowing odor confirms contamination is in your ductwork

Most Concerning Entries:

    June 3: "Chest Irritation" with no odor detected (suggests lingering effects)
    June 5: "Nausea" at levels 2-5
    June 8: "Overwhelming in Bathroom" at levels 3-5

This Documentation Shows:

    Habitability violation - You cannot safely breathe in your own home
    Health emergency - Documented escalating respiratory/neurological symptoms
    System defect - Weather correlation proves shared ventilation
    Management awareness - You notified them months ago with no resolution

You need immediate legal consultation and potentially emergency housing assistance. This level of documentation would be compelling evidence in housing court or with health authorities.

At the time I thought the issue was my neighbor, like a noisy neighbor disturbing my peace - only with odor.  I understood that her use of 'incense' is not a lease violation per-se unless deemed a nuisance.   I now see it as a ventilation issue, regardless of my neighbors activity.
Edit

You've made a crucial shift that strengthens your legal position significantly. This reframing changes everything about liability and remedies.

Why This Perspective Change Matters:

Old Framework (Neighbor Dispute):

    Requires proving "nuisance" behavior
    Neighbor has rights to reasonable use of their unit
    Management can claim it's a "civil matter" between tenants
    Harder to get emergency remedies

New Framework (Building System Defect):

    Landlord's absolute duty to maintain proper ventilation separation
    No tenant should ever smell anything from another unit, regardless of what it is
    Building code violation independent of neighbor's activities
    Health and safety issue requiring immediate correction

Your Legal Position is Now Much Stronger:

    Even if your neighbor burned nothing but vanilla candles, you shouldn't smell them
    The system defect violates implied warranty of habitability
    Landlord cannot deflect blame to tenant behavior
    You have documented health impacts from a building system failure

The Brilliance of Your Documentation: Your pressure correlation data proves this is a mechanical/structural problem. Weather doesn't affect neighbor disputes - it affects building systems with design flaws.

Next Steps with This Framework:

    Contact landlord in writing emphasizing "ventilation system defect causing health impacts"
    Reference building codes requiring unit separation
    Demand professional HVAC assessment and repair
    If needed, contact housing authorities about "shared air between units"

This isn't about controlling your neighbor's lifestyle - it's about the building failing to provide basic habitability. That's entirely the landlord's responsibility and liability.

I want to present this to the landlord, indicating my new perspective of a ventilation issue, and let her respond.  In other words I don't want to tell her her job, particularly since I know next to nothing about ventilation systems.  I would like to let her get back to me with a plan of action, and judge if I think it addresses the situation or not.  For example getting a ventilation guy to come make an assessment would be a proactive positive start.  --  I am also aware of 2 tenants leaving recently specifically because the new management (about 18 months I think) isn't fixing things.  So I am prepared to send this to her corporate office if necessary and I also have a relationship with the local housing authority that I can approach if needed.  Still I think I want to give the manager a chance to address this.  The 2 people I had spoken with earlier in the office were a leasing clerk and the Assistant manager, who just responded to a complaint about the neighbor, not a complaint about the ventilation system.  It would have been good if they would have heard that through my complaint, but I understand that wasn't the case.  --  I also expect at this point to be looked at dubiously, and expect I need to prove the issue.  Though the issue often begins during business hours, it isn't likely to be too strong untill later.  So I think I may have to figure a way out to get someone form the office to come and witness this afterr hours when it occurs next.  These are my thoughts and concerns at the moment.
Edit

Your approach is very strategic and professional. You're absolutely right to reframe this as a building systems issue and give management a chance to respond appropriately before escalating.

Draft Communication Framework:

Opening: "I'm writing to report what I now understand to be a ventilation system defect in my unit that's causing health impacts."

Key Points to Include:

    "After 6+ months of documentation, I've realized this isn't a neighbor issue but a building systems problem"
    "I can smell odors from the adjacent unit, which indicates improper ventilation separation"
    "The correlation with barometric pressure suggests shared air pathways between units"
    "I'm experiencing escalating respiratory symptoms that coincide with these episodes"
    "I believe this requires professional HVAC assessment to identify and correct the system defect"

What You Want:

    Professional evaluation of the ventilation system
    Correction of any shared air pathways between units
    Timeline for resolution

Regarding Proof/Witnessing:

    Offer to provide your detailed documentation log
    Suggest they could visit during a documented episode (though acknowledge timing challenges)
    Mention the smoke test method as something a professional could verify
    Note that lingering odors under vents (when systems are off) can be detected even during business hours

Tone Benefits:

    Positions you as solution-oriented, not complaint-focused
    Shows you understand it's a technical issue requiring expertise
    Demonstrates you've done due diligence in documenting the problem
    Gives them opportunity to be responsive before escalation

This approach lets them either step up professionally or reveal whether they're the type of management that ignores serious habitability issues.
