*AI Summary*  


**The provided text** is a log, titled "Odor Tracker," which meticulously records the occurrence and characteristics of a persistent odor over several months. Entries note the date of detection, provide a numerical intensity rating, and include brief notes about the odor's location, pervasiveness, and associated physical symptoms experienced by the recorder, such as nausea or chest irritation. Some entries also document air pressure readings, suggesting an attempt to correlate atmospheric conditions with the odor's presence or intensity. The log indicates that the odor issue was discussed with an office at one point and also notes instances where the odor was perceived when using heating or air conditioning.

**Based** on the provided "Odor Tracker" source, the issue appears to be a persistent and recurring odor problem documented over several months, starting at least in December 2024
.
Here are some impressions drawn directly from the log entries:

- **Duration and Persistence:** The issue spans from Spring 2024 through at least June 2025, indicating it is not a one-time event but a long-term problem
. The entry "Background of Persistent Odor issue" in December 2024 also explicitly states its persistent nature
.
- **Intensity Variation:** The odor's strength is tracked using a numerical scale (appearing to range from 1 to 5)
. Entries show the intensity fluctuating significantly, from trace (1) to overwhelming (5), mild to moderate (2), strong (3, 4), and super strong (2-4)
.
- **Location:** The odor is frequently noted as being particularly strong or present in the bathroom
. Descriptions include "Just in bathroom", "Bathroom by wall", "Strong in Bathroom", "Overwhelming in Bathroom, spilling into rest of the place", and "Bathroom Cloud"
.
- **Timing and Triggers:** The odor seems to appear or increase at specific times of day (mid-day, evening, through the night, afternoon building towards evening, starts @ 4pm)
. Entries also suggest potential links to HVAC system operation ("Blowing through with heat", "AC blowing odor") and potentially air pressure changes ("Low Air Pressure", "Pressure low", "Odor, air-pressure going up", and pressure readings noted alongside odor reports
).
- **Associated Symptoms:** The log records physical symptoms experienced, including mild nausea/headache
, feeling it in the chest, irritation in the chest, sinus clogged, and nausea. One entry specifically notes "Chest Irritation" with an intensity of 0 on June 3, 2025
.
- **Communication:** At least one instance of communication about the issue is noted: "Spoke with the office" on December 23, 2024
.

Overall, the source paints a picture of a troubling, ongoing environmental issue that is disruptive, varies in severity, appears linked to specific locations and potentially environmental factors like air pressure, and is associated with physical discomfort and symptoms
. The detailed tracking suggests an effort to understand and document the characteristics of this persistent odor.
